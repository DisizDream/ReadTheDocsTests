Overview
----

Scenes contain the objects of your game. They can be used to create a main menu, individual levels, and anything else. Think of each unique Scene file as a unique level. In each Scene, you will place your environments, obstacles, and decorations, essentially designing and building your game in pieces.

  -- A new empty scene, with the default 3D objects - a camera and a directional light.

When you create a new Unity project, your scene view will show a new Scene. This is an untitled and unsaved scene. The scene will be empty except for defult objects - either an orthographic camera, or a perspective camera and a directional light, depending on whether you started the project in 2D or 3D mode.
